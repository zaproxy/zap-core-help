The following changes were made in this release:
</p>

<H2>Significant changes:</H2>

<H3>Issue 133: Add Syntax highlighting to Response Panel</H3>

The HTML panels now support switchable syntax highlighting.

<H3>Issue 153: fuzzdb integration</H3>

The fuzzer includes fuzzdb (https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb) fuzzing files.<br/>
Note that some fuzzdb files have been left out as they cause common anti virus scanners to flag them as containing viruses.<br/>
You can replace them (and upgrade fuzzdb) by downloading the latest version of fuzzdb and expanding it in the 'fuzzers' library.

<H3>Issue 212: Parameter analysis</H3>

A new Params tab shows a summary of all of the parameters a site has used.  

<H3>Issue 228: Enhanced XSS scanner</H3>

The Cross Site Scripting active scanner has been rewritten from scratch to find more potential XSS issues and report fewer false positives. 

<H3>Issue 244: Port the Watcher passive checks</H3>

The following checks have been ported from Watcher (thanks to Chris Weber for oking this):
