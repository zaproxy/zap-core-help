<H1>Release 1.3.0</H1>
<p>
The following changes were made in this release:
</p>
<H2>Significant changes:</H2>

<H3>Fuzzing</H3>
Strings in a response can now be fuzzed to try to find vulnerabilities.<br>
Anti CRSF tokens can be detected and automatically regenerated when fuzzing.<br/>
This functionality is based on code from the OWASP JBroFuzz project.

<H3>Dynamic SSL certificates</H3>
The support for SSL connections was improved and simplified.<br>
User's can now create their own root certificate and distribute this into their HTTP clients.<br>
See <a href="../ui/dialogs/options/dynsslcert.html">Option: Dynamic SSL Certificates</a> for more details.  

<H3>Daemon mode and API</H3>
Starting ZAP with the "-daemon" command line option will cause it to run in the background in 'headless' mode, 
meaning that no UI is displayed.<br>
An initial API has been implemented in XML, JSON and HTML.<br>
If ZAP is running as a daemon then the API is automatically enabled, otherwise the API must be enabled via the Options API screen.<br>
The API can be navigated by opening http://zap/ in your browser when proxying via ZAP. 

<H3>Beanshell integration</H3>
The <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell</a> is an interactive Java shell that can be used to execute BeanShell scripts.<br> 
These scripts are a simplified form of Java that use many elements from Java syntax, but in a simpler scripting format. <br>
All Java code is also valid BeanShell code.<br>
BeanShell integration in OWASP ZAP enables you to write scripts using the ZAP functions and data set.<br> 
This can be a very powerful feature for analyzing web applications.<br>


<H3>Full internationalisation</H3>
All display string are now fully internationalised.

<H3>Localisation</H3>
Out of the box support for the following languages:
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>English</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Brazilian Portuguese</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Chinese</td></tr>

<H2>Minor changes:</H2>

<H3>Hex view</H3>
The <a href="../ui/tabs/request.html">Request</a>, <a href="../ui/tabs/response.html">Response</a> tabs now provide
a 'Hex View' option which will display the request and response bodies in hex format. 

<H3>Search results</H3>
The <a href="../ui/tabs/search.html">Search tab </a> now displays all instances of a string found rather than just the first instance
in each request or response. 

<H3>Exclude URLs</H3>
URLs can be explicitly excluded from the active scanner, spider and from the proxy.

<H3>Copy support</H3>
Most of the panels now provide a 'right click' 'Copy' menu option, including the Port Scan and Brute Force panels.

<H3>Undo/Redo support</H3>
All of the input fields now support Undo/Redo actions using the operating systems default Undo/Redo accelerators:
<UL>
<LI>Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y
<LI>Mac OS X: Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z
</UL>

<H3>Port scanner proxy support and timeout option</H3>
The Port Scanner can now use the outgoing proxy (if configured) and the timeout in milliseconds can also now be set.

<H3>Request and response break buttons</H3>
There are now 2 'Set Break' buttons to allow breaks to be set on all requests and all responses independently. 

<H3>Expand Sites and Information tab buttons</H3>
There are now 2 buttons which allow you to switch between having the Sites and Information tabs expanded.

<H3>Break tab icon changes colour when breakpoint hit</H3>
While the Break tab is not in use its icon is a grey cross: &nbsp;
<img src="../images/16/101grey.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" />&nbsp;.<br/>
When a <a href="../start/features/breakpoints.html">breakpoint</a> is hit the tab icon is changed 
to a red cross: &nbsp;
<img src="../images/16/101.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" />&nbsp;.<br/>

<H3>Adjustable timeout</H3>
The <a href="../ui/dialogs/options/connection.html">Option: Connection</a> screen allows you to set the timeout in seconds
to make it easier to test slow applications.

<H3>Library updates</H3>
Most of the libraries used by ZAP have been updated to the latest versions.

<H3>A new icon :)</H3>
Thanks to Simon Egli and all others for submitting cool icon suggestions.

<H2>Known issues:</H2>
<H3>Mac OS X: Dynamic SSL and Google Chrome</H3>
Currently Dynamic SSL is not working when using Google Chrome. This is because of an unresolved known issue with Google Chrome and Mac OS X Keychain. When importing OWASP ZAP's Root CA into the keychain and requesting a SSL website, an "Invalid certificate" error message is shown.
