<H1>Passive Scan</H1>
<p>
ZAP by default passively scans all HTTP messages (requests and responses) sent to the web application being tested.<br/>
Passive scanning does not change the requests nor the responses in any way and is therefore safe to use.<br/>
Scanning is performed in a background thread to ensure that it does not slow down the exploration
of an application.
</p>
<p>
The (main) behaviour of the passive scanner can be configured using the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/pscanner.html">Options Passive Scanner Screen</a>.
</p>
<p>
Passive scanning can also be used for automatically adding <a href="tags.html">tags</a>
and raising <a href="alerts.html">alerts</a> for potential issues.<br>
A set of rules for automatic tagging are provided by default. These can be changed, deleted or
added to via the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/pscan.html">Options Passive Scan Tags screen</a>.
</p>

<p>
The alerts raised by passive scanners can be configured using the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/pscanrules.html">Options Passive Scan Rules screen</a>.<br/>
