	<h1>Session Management</h1>
	<p>
		ZAP handles multiple types of session management (called <b>Session
			Management Methods</b>) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each <b><a
			href="contexts.html">Context</a></b> has a Session Management
		Method defined which dictates how sessions are kept.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="cbsm">Cookie-Based Session Management</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the case of this method the session is being tracked through
		cookies. Currently, the session tokens that are used are imported from
		the <a href="httpsessions.html">HTTP Sessions</a> Extension.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="hasm">HTTP Authentication Session Management</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the case of this method the session is managed with HTTP request header <code>Authorization</code>.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="sbsm">Script-Based Session Management</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This method is useful for websites / webapps where the session management is a more complex one and some custom
		scripts that handle the process are beneficial. To use this method, you must first define a Session Management script
		which analyses messages or performs other actions as needed by your web-application. This script is then selected for use for a given Context
		and it is called whenever session management actions are performed. 
		Configuration can be done using the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html#sm">Session
			Contexts Dialog</a> and requires you to have the Scripts Console ZAP Addon installed from the Marketplace.
