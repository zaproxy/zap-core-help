<H1>Scope</H1>
<p>
The Scope is the set of URLs you are testing, and is defined by the <a href="contexts.html">Contexts</a> 
you have specified.<br/><br/>
By default nothing is in scope.
</p>
<p>
The Scope potentially changes:
<ul>
<li>What you can do, when you are in Protected <a href="modes.html">mode</a></li>
<li>What is shown in the <a href="../../ui/tabs/history.html">History tab</a></li>
<li>Protected - user can only perform (potentially) dangerous actions on URLs in the Scope</li>
<li>Standard - as in previous releases, user can do anything</li>
<li>ATTACK - new nodes that are in Scope are <a href="ascan.html">actively scanned</a> as soon as they are discovered</li>
</ul>

It is recommended that you define a new <a href="contexts.html">Context</a> for each web application
that makes up the system you are testing, and set them in scope as you test each one.
