<H1>Active Scan</H1>
<p>
Active scanning attempts to find potential vulnerabilities by using
known attacks against the selected targets.
</p>
<p>
Active scanning is an attack on those targets. <br/>
You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not own.
</p>
<p>
In order to facilitate identifying ZAP traffic and Web Application Firewall exceptions, ZAP is accompanied 
by a script "AddZapHeader.js" which can be used to add a specific header to all traffic that passes through 
or originates from ZAP. eg: <tt>X-ZAP-Initiator: 3</tt>
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that active scanning can only find certain types of vulnerabilities.<br/>
Logical vulnerabilities, such as broken access control, will not be found by
any active or automated vulnerability scanning.<br/>
Manual penetration testing should always be performed in addition to active
scanning to find all types of vulnerabilities. 
</p>

<p>
Active scanning is configured using the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/ascan.html">Options Active Scan screen</a>.<br>
The rules that run are configured via <a href="scanpolicy.html">Scan Policies</a> - you can have as many of these as you like.
