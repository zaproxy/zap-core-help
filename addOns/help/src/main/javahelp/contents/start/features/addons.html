<H1>Add-ons</H1>
<p>
Add-ons add additional functionality to ZAP.<br/>
They have full access to all of the ZAP internals, and so can provide very powerful new features.<br/>
You can dynamically install add-ons from the online Add-on Marketplace via the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/manageaddons.html">Manage Add-ons dialog</a>.<br/>
You can typically add and remove add-ons to and from the ZAP UI without having to restart it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Add-ons can provide context sensitive help which is dynamically integrated with the help file.<br/>
If you are reading this page via a ZAP help file (as opposed to reading it online) then any
help pages associated with the add-ons you have installed will be available under 
<a href="../../addons/introduction.html">here</a>.<br/>

</p>
<p>
Add-ons are assigned a status which may be one of:
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
Release</td><td>which indicates they are of high quality and fit for purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
Beta</td><td>which indicates they are of reasonable quality but may be incomplete or need further testing</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
Alpha</td><td>which indicates they are at an early stage of development</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<H3>Location of add-ons available to ZAP</H3>

<ul>
