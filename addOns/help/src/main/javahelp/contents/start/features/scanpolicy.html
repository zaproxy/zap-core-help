<H1>Scan Policy</H1>
<p>
A scan policy defines exactly which <a href="../checks.html">rules</a> are run as part of an <a href="ascan.html">active scan</a>.<br>
It also defines how these rules run influencing how many requests are made and how likely potential issues are to be flagged.<br>
You can define as many scan policies as you like and select the most appropriate one when you start the scan via
the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/advascan.html">Active Scan Dialog</a>.<br>
You can define the default scan policy to be used for active scans and for the <a href="modes.html">Attack mode</a> via the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/ascan.html">Options Active Scan screen</a>.<br>
 

</p>
<p>
Active scanning is an attack on those targets. <br/>
You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not own.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that active scanning can only find certain types of vulnerabilities.<br/>
Logical vulnerabilities, such as broken access control, will not be found by
any active or automated vulnerability scanning.<br/>
Manual penetration testing should always be performed in addition to active
scanning to find all types of vulnerabilities. 
</p>

<p>
Active scanning is configured using the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/ascan.html">Options Active Scan screen</a>.<br>
You can also define as many scan policies as you like - these define exactly which rules are run and how they work.
