	<h1>Authentication Methods</h1>
	<p>
		ZAP handles multiple types of authentication (called <b>Authentication
			Methods</b>) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each <b><a
			href="contexts.html">Context</a></b> has an Authentication Method
		defined which dictates how authentication is handled. The
		authentication is used to create Web Sessions that correspond to
		authenticated webapp <a href="users.html">Users</a>.
	</p>

	<p>Authentication methods can be used in multiple places around
		ZAP. Some of the examples include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>defining Users and automatic login</li>
		<li>detection of authenticated/unauthenticated states</li>
		<li>performing automatic re-authentication</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Multiple authentication methods have been implemented and the
		system supports easy addition of new methods, according to user needs.
		They main ones are described below.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="manual">Manual Authentication</a>
	</h2>
	<p>This method allows users to perform the authentication manually
		(e.g. authenticate in the browser while proxy-ing through ZAP) and
		then select the corresponding HTTP session. As the actual
		authentication is being performed by you, this method does not support
		re-authentication in case the webapp logs a user out.
	</p>
	
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context 
	require choosing an authenticated HTTP session.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="formBased">Form-Based Authentication</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
		done by submitting a form or performing a GET request to a 'login url'
		using a 'username/password' pair of authentication credentials.
		Re-authentication is possible. Configuration can be done using the <a
			href="../../ui/dialogs/session/context-auth.html">Session
			Contexts Authentication screen</a> or using the contextual PopupMenu: <i>Flag as...
			Form-Based Authentication Login Request</i>.
	</p>
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
	setting up the <i>username/password</i> pair of credentials that are used for the form based
	authentication.</p>
	<p>
	If the application requires submitting the anti-CSRF token presented in the login page, ZAP will 
	handle it automatically. Make sure the token
	name is configured in <a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/anticsrf.html">Options Anti CSRF screen</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		<a name="jsonBased">JSON-Based Authentication</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
		done by submitting a JSON object to a 'login url' using a 'username/password'
		pair of authentication credentials.
		Re-authentication is possible. Configuration can be done using the <a
			href="../../ui/dialogs/session/context-auth.html">Session
			Contexts Authentication screen</a> or using the contextual PopupMenu: <i>Flag as...
			JSON-Based Authentication Login Request</i>.
	</p>
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
	setting up the <i>username/password</i> pair of credentials that are used for the
	authentication.</p>
	
	<h2>
		<a name="httpAuth">HTTP/NTLM Authentication</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
		enforced using the HTTP or NTLM Authentication mechanisms employing HTTP message headers. 
		Three authentication schemes are supported: Basic, Digest and NTLM.
		Re-authentication is possible, as the authentication headers are sent with every authenticated
		request. Configuration can be done using the <a
			href="../../ui/dialogs/session/context-auth.html">Session
			Contexts Authentication screen</a>.
	</p>
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
	setting up the <i>username/password</i> pair of credentials that are used for the HTTP/NTLM authentication.</p>
	
	<h2>
		<a name="scriptBased">Script-Based Authentication</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		This method is useful for websites / webapps where the authentication is a more complex one and some custom
		scripts that handle the authentication process are beneficial. To use this method, you must first define an Authentication 
		<a href="scripts.html">script</a> which sends messages or performs other actions as needed by your web-application. 
		This script is then selected for use for a given Context
		and it is called whenever an authentication is performed. Re-authentication is possible. 
		Configuration can be done using the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/session/context-auth.html">Session Contexts Authentication screen</a>.
	</p>
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
	setting up the a set of parameters defined in the script. For more details, see the provided Authentication Script examples.</p>
