<H1>A basic penetration test</H1>
<p>
A basic penetration test is made up of the following steps:

<H3>Explore</H3>
Use your browser to explore all of the functionality provided by the application.<br/>
Follow all links, press all buttons and fill in and submit all forms.<br/>
If the applications supports multiple roles then do this for each of the roles.<br/>
For each role save the ZAP session in a different file and start a new session before you
start using the next role. 

<H3>Spider</H3>
Use the <a href="features/spider.html">spider</a> to find URLs that you have either missed
or that are hidden. You can also use the AJAX Spider add-on
to improve the results and crawl the dynamic-built links.<br/>
Explore any links found.  

<H3>Forced Browse</H3>
Use the forced browse scanner to find unreferenced files and directories (requires "Forced Browse" add-on).<br/>

<H3>Active Scan</H3>
Use the <a href="features/ascan.html">active scanner</a> to find basic vulnerabilities.<br/>

<H3>Manual test</H3>
The above steps will find basic vulnerabilities.<br/>
However to find more vulnerabilities you will need to manually test the application.<br/>
See the OWASP Testing Guide for more details.<br/>
Future versions of the ZAP Desktop User Guide will describe how ZAP can be used to 
help this process.<br/>
