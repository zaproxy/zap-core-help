<H1>Session Context Data Driven Nodes screen</H1>
<p>
This is one of the <a href="contexts.html">Session Context screens</a>
which allows you to manage ZAP's understanding of the structure of the application.

<H2>Data Driven Nodes</H2>
Data Driven Nodes are a type of <a href="../../../start/features/structmods.html">Structural Modifier</a> that apply to this context.  For more details see the <a href="../../../start/features/ddc.html">Data Driven Content</a> help page.

<H3>Hierarchy</H3>
Data Driven Nodes can be structured into a Hierarchy so that the children of a Data Driven Node will inherent the parent's patterns as a prefix to their own patterns.  This allows for multiple DDNs to be applied to a single URL (ie. both http://example.org/path/to/ddn/123/another/ddn/987/ and http://example.org/path/to/ddn/456/another/ddn/789/ can be replaced with http://example.org/path/to/ddn/«node1»/another/ddn/«node2»/).
The order of the Data Driven Nodes also dictates their priority; Data Driven Nodes which are closer to the top of the Tree and at the top of their parent's children list will be applied first.
When Data Driven Nodes are evaluated once a match is found the remaining DDNs in the collection are not evaluated and instead evaluation continues with the Matched DDN's children.  This can be thought of as a 'greedy' matching approach which is dictated by the DDN's priority in the collection.

<H3>Pattern</H3>
A Data Driven Node's Pattern consists of four parts :
<ul>
<li>Parent Pattern - The full pattern inherited from the Parent Node.  This value is used as a prefix to all following values.
<li>Prefix Pattern - A pattern indicating the presence of a Data Driven Node.  This pattern will not be replaced and will remain in the final URI.
<li>Data Node Pattern - A pattern matching the possible values of the Data Node in the URI.  This pattern will be replaced with the Data Driven Node's Name wrapped in special characters to indicate it is a Data Driven Node.
<li>Suffix Pattern - A pattern matching values which follow the Data Node.  This pattern can be used to separate a Data Node Page and its Subpages.
</ul>

<H3>Tips & Tricks</H3>
<ul>
<li>Non-replacing Nodes : Data Driven Nodes only require a Name and a Prefix Pattern.  DDNs which do not have a Data Node Pattern are considered Non-replacing Nodes and function to support the structure of the Data Driven Nodes Tree.  For instance, you may want to group your DDNs by the Host that they apply to; in order to do so you could add a DDN to the root who's Prefix Pattern matches the Host in question.  Then add any additional Replacing DDNs as children of the Host Node with appropriate Prefix Patterns matching only the necessary Path portions of the URL.
<li>Recommended Data Node Pattern : The more specific the RegEx pattern to match the Data Node portion of the URL the better, but generally recommended patterns are <code>.+?</code> or <code>.+</code> which will match 1 or more of any characters.
<li>Data Node Pages, Subpages & the Suffix Pattern : To support both Data Node Pages and Subpages beneath them two Data Driven Node entries are required.  The two entries will use the same Prefix Pattern, but will have different Data Node & Suffix Patterns.  The Data Node Subpages entry should appear first in the Data Driven Node Tree since its Data Node Pattern is more specific than the Data Node Page.  The Data Node Subpages entry will use a Data Node Pattern similar to <code>.+?</code> with a Suffix Pattern usually set to <code>/ or another URL Path Delimiter character</code>.  The Data Node Subpages entry will use a Data Node Pattern similar to <code>.+</code> and its Suffix Pattern will be left blank.  It is recommended to name each DDN Entry with a different name (ie. DataNodePage & DataNodeSubpages) to distinguish between them in the Site Tree.
