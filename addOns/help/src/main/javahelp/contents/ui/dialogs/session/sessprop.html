<H1>Session Properties dialog</H1>
<p>
This allows you to set the session properties and is made up of the following screens:

<H3>General</H3>
This allows you to set the session name and description.

<H3>Exclude from Proxy</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the local proxies.

<H3>Exclude from Scanner</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the scanner.

<H3>Exclude from Spider</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the spiders (standard and AJAX).

<H3>Contexts</H3>
A set of screens for managing <a href="../../../start/features/contexts.html">contexts</a>

<H2>URL regexs</H2>
In the <I>Exclude from *</I> dialogs, you can enter regular expressions to define excluded URLs.
While you can escape a single meta-character with a backslash, you can also use the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence. All the characters between the <B>\Q</B> and the <B>\E</B> are interpreted as literal characters. E.g. \Q*\d+*\E matches the literal text *\d+*.
This escape sequence is used in ZAP when you exclude URLs via some context menus.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> If your URL contains a "\E", then you have to do the following steps when using the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence:
<UL>
	<LI>Open the escape sequence</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence before the "character" \E</LI>
	<LI>Escape the backslash</LI>
	<LI>Open after the "\E" another escape sequence;</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence as normally would.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Example: subdomain.example.com/path?a=<B>\E</B>&amp;moredata=2 should appear as
<I>\Qsubdomain.example.com/path?a=\E</I><B>\\E</B><I>\Q&amp;moredata=2\E</I>
