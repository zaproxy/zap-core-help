<H1>Options Connection screen</H1>
<p>
The Options Connection screen allows you to configure the ZAP connection options:

<H3>Timeout (in seconds)</H3>
This makes is easier to test slow applications.

<H3>Default User Agent</H3>
The user agent that ZAP should use when creating HTTP messages (for example, spider messages or CONNECT requests to outgoing
proxy).

<H3>Single Cookie Request Header</H3>
Controls whether the ZAP's managed cookies (Enable (Global) HTTP State) should be set
on a single "Cookie" request header or multiple "Cookie" request headers, when sending an HTTP request to the server.

<H3>Enable (Global) HTTP State</H3>
This allows session details stored in cookies to be tracked.<br/>
This option must be selected to enable the "Use current tracking session" checkbox in the 
<a href="../../dialogs/man_req.html">Manual Request Editor dialogs</a>.<br/>
Session tracking ensures that any requests are sent with the latest session details.<br/>
For example you may record a session when logged in as one user and then logout and login as another user.<br/>
If you resend a request from the first session without session tracking then it will use the cookies from 
the first session.<br/>
If you resend the same request with session tracking then it will use the cookies from the second session.

<H3>DNS</H3>
<h4>TTL Successful Queries</h4>
Defines for how long the successful DNS queries should be cached:<ul>
<li>Negative number, cache forever;</li>
<li>Zero, disables caching;</li>
<li>Positive number, the number of seconds the queries will be cached.</li></ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> Changes are applied after a restart.<p>
The option can also be set using the <code>-config</code> command line argument with the key <code>connection.dnsTtlSuccessfulQueries</code>.

<H3>Security Protocols</H3>
Allows to choose the SSL/TLS versions enabled for outgoing connections (for example, to servers). At least
one version must be enabled, versions unsupported by the JRE will be unselected and disabled.
<br>The option SSLv2Hello must be selected in conjunction with at least one SSL/TLS version.

<H3>Use Proxy Chain</H3>
This section allows you to connect to another proxy for outgoing connections.<br/>
This is often required in a corporate environment.

<H3>Proxy Authentication</H3>
This section allows you to configure the outgoing proxy authentication.
