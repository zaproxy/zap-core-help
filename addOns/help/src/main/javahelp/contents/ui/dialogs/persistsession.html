<H1>Persist Session dialog</H1>

This dialog is shown by default whenever you start a new session, which always happens when ZAP starts.<br>
It allows you to specify how you would like this session persisted, you can also set the default choice so that you are not prompted again.
<p>
Persisting a session means it will be stored in a local database that you can access at a later date.<br>
You do not need to keep 'saving' a session as everything that happens in the session is continually recorded.<br>
It is much faster to persist a session at the start, but you can always persist a session later if you need to.<br>
If you close ZAP without persisting your session then you will not be able to access it again.

<H3>Yes, I want to persist this session with name based on the current timestamp</H3>
Chose this option if you would like ZAP to store the session in the default directory with a name based on the current time.

<H3>Yes, I want to persist this session but I want to specify the name and location</H3>
Chose this option if you would like to specify exactly where ZAP should store the session.

<H3>No, I do not want to persist this session at this moment in time</H3>
Chose this option if you do not want ZAP to store the session.<br>
You can choose to store it at a later time using the <a href="../tlmenu/file.html">Persist Session...</a> menu item. 

<H3>Remember my choice and do not ask me again.</H3>
Check this box if you want ZAP to remember your decision and not prompt you again.<br>
You can change your decision via the <a href="options/database.html">Options database</a> screen.
