<H1>Options Scripts screen</H1>
<p>
This screen allows you to configure the script options:
</p>
<H3>Directories</H3>
<p>A list of directories from which scripts will be loaded. ZAP will read (and write) the scripts using the character encoding UTF-8.</p>
<p>The scripts must be in subdirectories named after the relevant script type (such as 'active', 'passive', 'proxy' etc) and must have an appropriate extension for the script language used.</p>
<p>Scripts that cannot be written to will be added to the Templates section.</p>
<p>The ZAP community scripts repository is a good option to add: <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts">https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts</a></p>
<p>You will need to clone a local copy but you can then access all of the scripts that the community add, and even upload your own scripts via GitHub pull requests.</p>
