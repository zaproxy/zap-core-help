<H1>Options language screen</H1>

The language screen allows you to configure:

<H3>Language selection</H3>
The language ZAP uses for its display.<br>
A set of languages are built into ZAP, however more languages may be available after the last release.<br>
Check the ZAP download page for the latest language pack available.<br>

<H3>Use system's locale for formatting</H3>
If the formatting of numbers, dates, and times is done with the system's locale instead of the locale of the selected language.

<H3>Language pack import</H3>
Besides the selection of the language that is used for ZAP's display, the import tool enables you to import new language packs or language file updates.
A language file pack will always have the extension <em>zaplang</em>. (E.g. language-pack-en_GB.zaplang)
<br/>
After the import you will immediately be able to select the newly imported language from the language selection drop down menu on the top of the screen.
<br/>
<b>Note that you will need to restart ZAP in order to finally apply the new language.</b>
