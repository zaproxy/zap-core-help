<p>
ZAP supports scripts that can be embedded within ZAP and can access internal ZAP data structures and classes.
These scripts allow you to dynamically enhance ZAP from within ZAP.
<p>
ZAP supports any scripting language that supports <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223">JSR 223</a>, including:
<ul>
<li>ECMAScript / JavaScript (through the <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/graalvm-javascript/">GraalVM JavaScript add-on</a>)</li>

<li>Ruby - <a href="https://jruby.org/">https://jruby.org/</a></li>
<li>and many more...</li> 
</ul>

<strong>WARNING - scripts run with the same permissions as ZAP, so do not run any scripts that you do not trust!</strong>

<H2>Script Types</H2>
Different types of scripts are supported:
<ul>
<li>Active Rules - these run as part of the Active Scanner and can be individually enabled</li>
<li>Authentication - scripts that are invoked when authentication is performed for a Context. 
To be used, they need to be selected when configuring the Script-Based Authentication Method for a Context. </li> 
<li>Extender - scripts which can add new functionality, including graphical elements and new API end points</li>
<li>HTTP Sender - scripts that run against every request/response sent/received by ZAP. This includes the proxied messages, messages sent during active scan, fuzzer, ...</li>
<li>Input Vector - scripts for defining exactly what ZAP should attack. They can also change how any URL is represented in the Sites Tree</li>
<li>Passive Rules - these run as part of the Passive Scanner and can be individually enabled</li> 
<li>Proxy - these run 'inline', can change every request and response and can be individually enabled. They can also trigger break points</li> 
<li>Session Management - scripts that define how an application manages sessions</li>
<li>Stand Alone - scripts that are self contained and are only run when your start them manually</li>
<li>Targeted - scripts that are invoked with a target URL and are only run when your start them manually</li>
