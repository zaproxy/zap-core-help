<H1>Active Scan tab</H1>

The Active Scan tab allows you to perform an <a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a>.<br> 
<br>
The 'New Scan' button launches the <a href="../dialogs/advascan.html">Active Scan dialog</a> which allows you
to specify exactly what should be scanned.
<br><br>
The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and resume the scan selected.<br>
A progress bar shows how far the scan of the selected site has progressed.<br>
The 'Current scans' value shows how many scans are currently active - 
hovering over this value will show a list of the sites being scanned in a popup.<br>
The 'Show scan progress details' button <img src="../../images/fugue/system-monitor.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /> launches the <a href="../dialogs/scanprogress.html">Scan Progress dialog</a>
which allows you to see details about which rules are running, skip individual rules and see a chart of the responses.

<H2>Right click menu</H2>
Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<H3>Exclude from</H3>

<H4>Proxy</H4>

<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Resend dialog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.
