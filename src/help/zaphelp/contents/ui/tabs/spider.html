	<h1>Spider tab</h1>
	<p>
		The Spider tab shows you the set of unique URIs found by the <a
			href="../../start/concepts/spider.html">Spider</a> during the scans.
	</p>

	<p>
		The 'New Scan' button launches the <a href="../dialogs/spider.html">Spider dialog</a> which allows you
to specify exactly what should be scanned.<br>
	
		The Spider can be run on multiple Sites in parallel and the results for each scan are
		shown by selecting the scan via the 'Progress' pull-down.
	</p>

	<p>The toolbar shows information about a scan and allows to control it. It provides a
		set of buttons which allows to:
	
	<ul>
		<li><img align="bottom" alt="pause button" src="../../images/16/141.png">
			Pause (and <img alt="resume button" src="../../images/16/131.png"> resume) the
			selected spider scan;</li>
		<li><img align="bottom" alt="stop button" src="../../images/16/142.png"> Stop
			the selected spider scan;</li>
		<li><img align="bottom" alt="clean scans button" src="../../images/fugue/broom.png">
			Clean completed scans;</li>
		<li><img align="bottom" alt="show messages button" src="../../images/16/178.png">
			Show/Hide Messages - shows/hides a tab (called Messages) that displays all HTTP
			messages sent by the selected spider scan;</li>
		<li><img align="bottom" alt="spider options button" src="../../images/16/041.png">
			Open the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/spider.html">Spider Options screen</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	The progress bar shows how far the selected spider scan has progressed. It is also shown
	the number of active spider scans and the number of URIs found for the selected scan.
	<p>For each URI found you can see:
	<ul>
		<li>Processed - Whether the URI was processed by the Spider or
			was skipped from fetching because of a rule (e.g. it was out of
			scope)</li>
		<li>Method - The HTTP method, e.g. GET or POST, through which the
			resource should be accessed</li>
		<li>URI - the resource found</li>
		<li>Flags - any information about the URI (e.g. if it's a seed or
			why was it not processed)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For each spider message, shown under the Messages tab, you can see details of the request sent and response
		received, moreover it's indicated, in the column <code>Processed</code>, whether or not the message was processed
		(that is, the response was successfully received and parsed).
