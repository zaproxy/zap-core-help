<H1>The File menu</H1>
This menu handles the current session. By default the following menu items will be present:<br/>

<H3>New Session</H3>
This creates a new session.<br>
If you have not saved your current session then a warning will be displayed.<br/>
Starting a new session without saving the current session will loose all of the data in the current session.

<H3>Open Session...</H3>
This opens a session that has been previously saved.<br/>
Opening a session without saving the current session will loose all of the data in the current session.

<H3>Persist Session...</H3>
This persists the current session. <br/>
While the session is always stored in a database on disk, it will be lost when ZAP is stopped unless it has been persisted.<br/>
You only need to persist it once - after that all changes will be saved.

<H3>Snapshot Session</H3>
This saves a snapshot of a session that has already been persisted.<br/>
It will use the same filename with a date-time string appended to it.<br/>

<H3>Properties...</H3>
This displays the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog.<br/>
This allows you to set the session name and description.

<H3>Load Add-on file...</H3>
Load a local <a href="../../start/concepts/addons.html">add-on</a> file.<br/>
Add-ons are typically installed from via the <a href="../dialogs/manageaddons.html">Manage Add-ons</a> dialog, but this
option can be useful if you have downloaded an add-on manually or are testing one you have developed yourself.<br/>
Add-ons remain installed until you manually uninstall them. 

<H3>Exit and delete session...</H3>
This will exit ZAP and delete the session, even if you have previously persisted it.<br/>
The session will no longer be accessible when you restart ZAP, although any snapshots you tool will still be available.<br/> 
A warning dialog will be displayed to ensure you really meant to choose this option.

<H3>Exit</H3>
This will exit ZAP.<br/>
If you have not saved the current session then you will be given the option to do so.

<p>
Note that <a href="../../start/concepts/addons.html">add-ons</a> can add additional menu items.
