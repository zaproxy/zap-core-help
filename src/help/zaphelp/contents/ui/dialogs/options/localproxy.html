<H1>Options Local Proxy screen</H1>
<p>
The Options Connection screen allows you to configure the address and port 
on which ZAP accepts incoming connections.<br/>
It is this address and port that you must configure your browser to use as a proxy.
</p>

<H3>Behind NAT</H3>
Indicates that the Local Proxy (ZAP) is behind NAT. When selected ZAP will attempt to
determine the public IP address, to properly detect and handle requests with the public
IP address (for example, to be served by the ZAP API).
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This option is only supported when ZAP is running in an AWS EC2 instance.
ZAP will obtain the public IP address from
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#working-with-ip-addresses">AWS EC2
instance's metadata</a>.<br>
ZAP should be started with this option enabled if access to the API, through the public IP address, is required:
<blockquote>zap.sh -daemon -port 8080 -host 0.0.0.0 -config proxy.behindnat=true</blockquote>
Also, the <a href="api.html">API</a> needs to be configured to accept external IP addresses (i.e. the IP
address from where ZAP is being accessed).

<H3>Remove Unsupported Encodings</H3>
Allows the proxy to remove unsupported encodings from the "Accept-Encoding" request-header field, so 
no (unsupported) encoding transformations are done to the response.<br/>
This option should be always enabled unless when testing the encoding transformations.<br/>
The messages encoded with unsupported encodings will not be correctly scanned (either by passive and active scanners).

<H3>Security Protocols</H3>
Allows to choose the SSL/TLS versions enabled for incoming connections (for example, from browsers). At least
one version must be enabled, versions unsupported by the JRE will be unselected and disabled.
