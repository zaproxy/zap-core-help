<H1>Session Properties dialog</H1>
<p>
This allows you to set the session properties and is made up of 4 screens:

<H3>General screen</H3>
This allows you to set the session name and description.

<H3>Exclude from proxy</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the proxy.

<H3>Exclude from scanner</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the scanner.

<H3>Exclude from spider</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the spider.

<H3>Exclude from WebSocket</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs where WebSocket communication is not processed in ZAP.
<BR>
Although all messages from excluded URLs are forwarded, nothing is stored nor can you view them in the user interface.
This feature is useful for high volume, performance critical WebSocket connections.
<BR>
You can differentiate on the port for one given domain, by using e.g.: <I>example.com:443</I> to exclude WebSocket connections from example.com only on port 443.

<H2>URL regexs</H2>
In the <I>Exclude from *</I> dialogs, you can enter regular expressions to define excluded URLs.
While you can escape a single meta-character with a backslash, you can also use the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence. All the characters between the <B>\Q</B> and the <B>\E</B> are interpreted as literal characters. E.g. \Q*\d+*\E matches the literal text *\d+*.
This escape sequence is used in ZAP when you exclude URLs via some context menus.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> If your URL contains a "\E", then you have to do the following steps when using the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence:
<UL>
	<LI>Open the escape sequence</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence before the "character" \E</LI>
	<LI>Escape the backslash</LI>
	<LI>Open after the "\E" another escape sequence;</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence as normally would.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Example: https://subdomain.example.com/path?a=<B>\E</B>&moredata=2 should appear as
<I>\Qhttps://subdomain.example.com/path?a=\E</I><B>\\E</B><I>\Q&moredata=2\E</I>
