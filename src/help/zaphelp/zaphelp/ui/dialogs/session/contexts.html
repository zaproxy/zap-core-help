<H1>Session Contexts dialogs</H1>
<p>
These screens allows you manage <a href="../../../start/concepts/contexts.html">contexts</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is a set of screens for each context you define.
</p>

<H3>Top screen</H3>
This allows you to set the context name and description.

<H3>Include in context</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be included in the context.<br/>
URLs which dont match any of the regexs will not be included in the context.

<H3>Exclude from context</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be excluded from the context.<br/>
You only need to specify regexs for URLs that you do not want to include but which match one or more
of the 'include' regexes.

<H3>Technology</H3>
This allows you to specify the technologies used in the context, if known.<br/>
By default all technologies are included.<br/>
If you exclude technologies that you know are not used then this may speed up 
<a href="../../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scanning</a> as rules specific to the excluded
technologies can be skipped.

<H3><a name="auth">Authentication</a></H3>
This allows you to manage the way in which Authentication is being done for the Context. 
After selecting the Authentication Method type, the options that need to be configured 
depend on the Authentication Method.

<h4>Manual Authentication</h4>
No configuration is needed for this authentication method. <small>Read  
<a href="../../../start/concepts/authentication.html#manual">more</a>...</small>

<h4>Form-Based Authentication</h4>
To configure this authentication method, you need to supply the 'login url', to which the 
request is performed, and the request body (POST data) and identify the parameters used to supply
the 'username' and 'password'. If no request body is supplied, the login request is performed as 
a HTTP GET, otherwise an HTTP POST is done. <small>Read

<h3>Session Management</h3>
This allows you to manage the way in which Session Management is being done for the Context. 
After selecting the Session Management Method type, the options that need to be configured 
depend on the Session Management Method.

<h3>Users</h3>
This allows you to configure a set of Users that may be used for various other actions
throughout the application.
<p>The credentials section of the Users depends on the Authentication Method configured
for the Context.</p>

<H2>URL regexs</H2>
In the <I>Include in *</I> and <I>Exclude from *</I> dialogs, you can enter regular expressions to define excluded URLs.
While you can escape a single meta-character with a backslash, you can also use the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence. All the characters between the <B>\Q</B> and the <B>\E</B> are interpreted as literal characters. E.g. \Q*\d+*\E matches the literal text *\d+*.
This escape sequence is used in ZAP when you exclude URLs via some context menus.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> If your URL contains a "\E", then you have to do the following steps when using the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence:
<UL>
	<LI>Open the escape sequence</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence before the "character" \E</LI>
	<LI>Escape the backslash</LI>
	<LI>Open after the "\E" another escape sequence;</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence as normally would.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Example: https://subdomain.example.com/path?a=<B>\E</B>&amp;moredata=2 should appear as
<I>\Qhttps://subdomain.example.com/path?a=\E</I><B>\\E</B><I>\Q&amp;moredata=2\E</I>
