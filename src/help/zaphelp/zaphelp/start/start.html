The quickest way to get going with ZAP is to use the Quick Start add-on, which is installed by default.<br/>
This allows you to enter a URL which ZAP will first <a href="concepts/spider.html">spider</a>
and then <a href="concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a>.<br/>
For a more in depth test you should explore your application using your browser or automated regression tests while proxying through ZAP.
</p>

<p>
At its heart ZAP is an <a href="concepts/intercept.html">intercepting proxy</a>.<br/>
You need to configure your browser to connect to the web application you wish to test through ZAP.<br/> 
If required you can also configure ZAP to connect through another proxy - this is often 
necessary in a corporate environment.<br/>
</p>
<p>
If you know how to set up proxies in your web browser then go ahead and give it a go!<br>
If you are unsure then have a look at the <a href="proxies.html">Configuring proxies</a>
section.
</p>
<p>
Once you have configured ZAP as your browser's proxy then try to connect to the web application
you will be testing.<br/>
If you can not connect to it then check your proxy settings again. You will need to check your 
browser's proxy settings, and also ZAP's proxy settings. <br>
Its also worth checking that the application that you are trying to test is running!
</p>
<p>
When you have successfully connected to your application via your browser then have a look at ZAP
again. You should now see one or more lines in the <a href="../ui/tabs/sites.html">Sites</a> and
<a href="../ui/tabs/history.html">History</a> tabs.<br/>
If so we're in business. If not then you'll need to check your proxy settings again.
</p>
<p>
The next thing to do is to start a 
<a href="../pentest/pentest.html">basic penetration test</a>.<br/>
