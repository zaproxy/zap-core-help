<p>
ZAP is an Intercepting Proxy. It allows you to see all of the requests you make to a web app
and all of the responses you receive from it.<br>
Amongst other things this allows you to see AJAX calls that may not otherwise be obvious.
</p>
<p>
You can also set <a href="breakpoints.html">break points</a> which allow you to change the requests and responses on the fly.
