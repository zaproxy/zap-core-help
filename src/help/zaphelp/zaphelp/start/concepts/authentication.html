	<h1>Authentication</h1>
	<p>
		ZAP handles multiple types of authentication (called <b>Authentication
			Methods</b>) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each <a
			href="contexts.html"><b>Context</b></a> has an Authentication Method
		defined which dictates how authentication is handled. The
		authentication is used to create Web Sessions that correspond to
		authenticated webapp <a href="users.html">Users</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In order to detect when response messages from web servers correspond
		to authenticated requests, a set of indicators can be configured. The
		<b>Logged in indicator</b>, when present in a response message (either
		the header or the body), signifies that the response message
		corresponds to an authenticated request (e.g. presence of a 'logout
		link' or a 'Welcome back, User X' pattern). Similarly, the <b>Logged
			out indicator</b> indicates an unauthenticated request (e.g. presence of
		a 'login link'). Only the presence of one of the 2 indicators is
		sufficient for proper functionality. In the case neither of the
		indicators has been specified, all messages are considered, by
		default, authenticated.
	</p>

	<p>In order to perform the authentication of an user on a website /
		in a webapp, the Authentication Method defines how the authentication
		is done (the process), while the necessary credentials (the exact
		identifiers) are dependent on the user, so, in ZAP, they are
		configured in the Users.</p>

	<p>Authentication methods can be used in multiple places around
		ZAP. Some of the examples include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>defining Users and automatic login</li>
		<li>detection of authenticated/unauthenticated states</li>
		<li>performing automatic re-authentication</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Multiple authentication methods have been implemented and the
		system supports easy addition of new methods, according to user needs.
		They main ones are described below.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="manual">Manual Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>This method allows users to perform the authentication manually
		(e.g. authenticate in the browser while proxy-ing through ZAP) and
		then select the corresponding HttpSession. As the actual
		authentication is being performed by you, this method does not support
		re-authentication in case the webapp logs an user out.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="formBased">Form-Based Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
		done by submitting a form or performing a GET request to a 'login url'
		using a 'username/password' pair of authentication credentials.
		Re-authentication is possible. Configuration can be done using the <a
			href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html#auth">Session
			Contexts Dialog</a> or using the contextual PopupMenu: <i>Flag as...
			Form-Based Authentication Login Request</i>.
