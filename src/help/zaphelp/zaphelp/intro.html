OWASP ZAP User Guide</H1>
<p>
Welcome to the The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) User Guide.<br/><br/>
This is available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online at 
http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/HelpIntro
<p>
ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. 
<p>
It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for 
developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing. 
<p>
ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.
<p>
If you are new to ZAP then its recommended that you look at the <a href="start/start.html">Getting Started</a> section.
<p>
ZAP is a fork of the open source variant of the <a href="paros.html">Paros Proxy</a>.
