<h1>Fuzzer tab</h1>

The Fuzzer tab shows you the requests and responses performed when you <a href="../../start/concepts/fuzz.html">fuzz</a>
a string.<br>
Selecting a row see the full requests and responses.
You can also search for strings in the fuzz results using the <a href="search.html">Search tab</a>. 
<br>
	<h2>HTTP Fuzzer results</h2>
	The results have to be manually assessed to know if any vulnerability was found.
	<br> Meaning of values of the "State" column:
	<ul>
		<li>"Successful" - the message was successfully sent/received;</li>
		<li>"Error" - an error occurred while creating or sending/receiving the message
			(for example: malformed HTTP message, time out while reading the response);</li>
		<li>"Reflected" - the injected fuzz string (value of "Fuzz" column) was found in
			the response body.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Right click menu</h2>
Right clicking on a row will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<h3>Exclude from</h3>
This menu has the following submenus:

<h4>Proksi</h4>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown 
in any of the tabs.<br/>
This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you are currently testing.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Skaner</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Spayder</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h3>Yenidən göndər...</h3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Resend dialog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.

<h3>Yeni həyəcan...</h3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/addalert.html">Add Alert dialog</a> which allows you to manually record a new  
<a href="../../start/concepts/alerts.html">alert</a> against this request.
