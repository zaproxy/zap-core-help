	<h1>Http Sessions tab</h1>
	<p>
		This tab shows you the set of identified HTTP sessions for each Site,
		as detected by the <a href="../../start/concepts/httpsessions.html">HTTP
			Sessions extension</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The current Site the information is referring to can be selected via
		the toolbar or the <a href="sites.html">Sites tab</a>.
	</p>

	<p>The toolbar provides a button ("New Session") which allows you
		to start a new session, forcing all outgoing request messages to be
		without the session tokens set, so the server considers it's a new
		session. This allows the creation of a new session, without destroying
		the old one.</p>

	<p>Each of the entries in the Sessions table (each session)
		initially has a generated name, but it can be changed by selecting the
		'Name' cell and editing it.</p>

	<p>Each of the entries in the Sessions table can be right clicked,
		which activates the Popup Menu, with the following options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Remove Session - deletes the session</li>
		<li>Set as active (available only on non-active sessions) - marks
			this session as active. If any session was previously set as active,
			it will be unset as active and, if it doesn't specify any token
			values, it is deleted.</li>
		<li>Unset as active (available only on the active session) -
			marks this session as not being active anymore. If the session
			doesn't specify any token values, it is deleted.</li>
	</ul>

	<i>Regarding the active session, more details can be read on the
		general concepts help page of the <a
		href="../../start/concepts/httpsessions.html">HTTP Sessions
			extension</a>
	</i>
	<br />

	<br /> For each session you can see:
	<ul>
		<li>Active - Whether this is the active session or not</li>
		<li>Name - The session name</li>
		<li>Session Tokens' Values - the list of values associated to
			each of the session tokens. The entries are separated by the ';'
			symbol.</li>
		<li>Messages Matched - the number of HTTP messages that have been
			matched by the extension with this session</li>
	</ul>
