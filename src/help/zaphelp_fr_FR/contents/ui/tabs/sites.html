<h3>Include in Context</h3>
This menu allows you to include the selected nodes and all of their subordinates in the specified

<h3>Exclure de</h3>
This menu has the following submenus:

<h4>Proxy</h4>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown 
in any of the tabs.<br/>
This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you are currently testing.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Propriétés de la session</a> dialog   

<h4>Scanner</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Propriétés de la session</a> dialog

<h3>Supprimer</h3>
This will remove the node and all of its children from ZAP.<br/>
However they can be added back in, to prevent this use the 'Exclude from' menus. 

<h3>Arrêt...</h3>
This will bring up a new window which will allow you to set a 
<a href="../../start/concepts/breakpoints.html">break point</a> on that URL.<br/>
The break point is defined via a regular expression. If you visit a URL which matches this 
expression then ZAP will intercept it and allow you to change either the request and/or the
response.

<h3>Rafraîchissez l'arbre des Noeuds</h3>
If the URL selected has <a href="../../start/concepts/alerts.html">alerts</a> associated with it then 
they will be listed under this menu.<br>
Selecting one of the alerts will cause it to be displayed.

<h3>Renvoyer...</h3>

<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Resend dialog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.

<h3>Nouvelle alerte...</h3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/addalert.html">Add Alert dialog</a> which allows you to manually record a new  
<a href="../../start/concepts/alerts.html">alert</a> against this request.

<h3>Afficher dans l'onglet Historique</h3>
This will show the selected node in the <a href="history.html">History tab</a>.

<h3>Ouvrir l'URL dans le navigateur</h3>
This will open the URL of the selected node in your default browser.

<h3>Generate anti CSRF test form</h3>
This will open a URL which will give you a generated form for testing for CSRF issues.<br>
It will only be enabled for POST requests, if the API is enabled and if Java supports the opening of URLs 
in a browser on your platform. 

<h3>Actualiser l'arborescence des Sites</h3>
Occasionally the Sites tree can be displayed incorrectly - this option will redraw it.
