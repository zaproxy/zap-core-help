	<p>
		ZAP handles multiple types of authentication (called <b>Authentication
			Methods</b>) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each <b><a
			href="contexts.html">Context</a></b> has an Authentication Method
		defined which dictates how authentication is handled. The
		authentication is used to create Web Sessions that correspond to
		authenticated webapp <a href="users.html">Users</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In order to detect when response messages from web servers correspond
		to authenticated requests, a set of indicators can be configured. The
		<b>Logged in indicator</b>, when present in a response message (either
		the header or the body), signifies that the response message
		corresponds to an authenticated request (e.g. presence of a 'logout
		link' or a 'Welcome back, User X' pattern). Similarly, the <b>Logged
			out indicator</b> indicates an unauthenticated request (e.g. presence of
		a 'login link'). Only the presence of one of the 2 indicators is
		sufficient for proper functionality. In the case neither of the
		indicators has been specified, all messages are considered, by
		default, authenticated.
	</p>
		
	<p> To set one of the <b>Logged in/out Indicators</b>, either type the regex 
		directly in the <i><a href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html#auth">Session
		Properties</a> dialog -> Authentication panel -> Logged In/Out Indicator field</i>,
		either find an authenticated message in the Sites Tree, select it, open the
		Response View and select the text you wish to define as the indicator using the
		mouse and select the <i>Flag as Context... Logged in/out indicator</i> right-click menu option.
	</p>

	<p>In order to perform the authentication of an user on a website /
		in a webapp, the Authentication Method defines how the authentication
		is done (the process), while the necessary credentials (the exact
		identifiers) are dependent on the user, so, in ZAP, they are
		configured in the Users.</p>
	
	<p>The generic <b>main steps</b> that are needed to configure authentication for a web application
	are the following:
	<ol>
		<li>properly configure a ZAP <a href="contexts.html">Context</a> for the web application</li>
		<li>set up the <a href="sessionManagement.html">session management method</a> for the context to
		the one that is used in your app</li>
		<li>set up the authentication method for the context:
			<ol>
				<li>set up at least one of the <i>Logged In Indicator</i> or the <i>Logged out indicator</i>,
				as described above</li>
				<li>configure the authentication method for your application, specifying all the requirements
				(as seen below)</li>
			</ol>
		</li> 
		<li>configure a set of <a href="users.html">users</a> for the context that directly correspond to the
		authentication method for the context</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Authentication methods can be used in multiple places around
		ZAP. Some of the examples include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>defining Users and automatic login</li>
		<li>detection of authenticated/unauthenticated states</li>
		<li>performing automatic re-authentication</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Multiple authentication methods have been implemented and the
		system supports easy addition of new methods, according to user needs.
		They main ones are described below.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="manual">Manual Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>This method allows users to perform the authentication manually
		(e.g. authenticate in the browser while proxy-ing through ZAP) and
		then select the corresponding HttpSession. As the actual
		authentication is being performed by you, this method does not support
		re-authentication in case the webapp logs an user out.
	</p>
	
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring an User for the context 
	require choosing an authenticated HTTP session.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="formBased">Form-Based Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
		done by submitting a form or performing a GET request to a 'login url'
		using a 'username/password' pair of authentication credentials.
		Re-authentication is possible. Configuration can be done using the <a
			href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html#auth">Session
			Contexts Dialog</a> or using the contextual PopupMenu: <i>Flag as...
			Form-Based Authentication Login Request</i>.
	</p>
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring an User for the context requires
	setting up the <i>username/password</i> pair of credentials that are used for the form based
	authentication.</p>
	
	<h3>
		<a name="httpAuth">HTTP/NTLM Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
		enforced using the HTTP or NTLM Authentication mechanisms employing HTTP message headers. 
		Three authentication schemes are supported: Basic, Digest and NTLM.
		Re-authentication is possible, as the authentication headers are sent with every authenticated
		request. Configuration can be done using the <a
			href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html#auth">Session
			Contexts Dialog</a>.
	</p>
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring an User for the context requires
	setting up the <i>username/password</i> pair of credentials that are used for the HTTP/NTLM authentication.</p>
	
	<h3>
		<a name="scriptBased">Script-Based Authentication</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This method is useful for websites / webapps where the authentication is a more complex one and some custom
		scripts that handle the authentication process are beneficial. To use this method, you must first define an Authentication script
		which sends messages or performs other actions as needed by your web-application. This script is then selected for use for a given Context
		and it is called whenever an authentication is performed. Re-authentication is possible. 
		Configuration can be done using the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html#auth">Session
			Contexts Dialog</a> and requires you to have the Scripts Console ZAP Addon installed from the Marketplace.
	</p>
	<p>When using this authentication method, configuring an User for the context requires
	setting up the a set of parameters defined in the script. For more details, see the provided Authentication Script examples.</p>
	
	<h2>Configuration example</h2>
	<p>A configuration example showing how to fully configure a webapp that uses <i>form-based authentication</i> and
	<i>cookie-based session management</i> is 
	seen below:
	<ol>
		<li>set up a context for the web application</li>
		<li>set up the session management method to <i>Cookie-based Session Management</i></li>
		<li>make sure your browser proxies everything through ZAP and log into your application using the browser</li>
		<li>go to ZAP and identify the request that was done for the login (most usually it's a HTTP POST request 
		containing the username and the password and possibly other elements)</li>
		<li>right click on the request and Flag as Context... Form-based Auth Login Request</li>
		<li>a window will be opened already containing the request URL and the parameters (if any). Use 
		the dropdown options to select which of the parameters correspond to the username and to the password</li>
    	<li>then you need to tell ZAP how to identify whether an authentication succeeded or not. You can do 
    	this by setting logged in or logged indicators. These are regex patterns which, if found in a 
    	response, tell ZAP whether it's authenticated or not (e.g. presence of a 
    	http://example.com/logout link or the presence of a 'Welcome, User X'). Only one of them is
    	necessary. To set one of them, either type the regex directly in the Session Properties -> 
    	Authentication -> Logged In Indicator, either find an authenticated message in the Sites Tree,
    	select it, open the Response View and select the text you wish to define as the indicator using
    	the mouse and select the Flag as Context... Logged in indicator right-click menu option.</li>
    	<li>define as many users as you need in the Session Properties -> Users section.</li>
    	<li>after this step, various actions are available in ZAP. For example, you now have a new right click option: Attack -> Spider Context As User. Or, using the Forced User Mode, you can force all the interactions that go through ZAP for a given Context to be from the perspective of a User. The User Forced Mode is enabled via the previous-to-last button in the toolbar (the one with the user and the lock) and is configured via Session Properties -> Forced User Mode.</li>
	</ol>
	
	Most of the steps above apply as well for other authentication methods. The only things that change when trying
	to configure authentication using a different method are steps 3, 4, 5 and 6. Instead of these, select the authentication
	method required from the drop-down list and configure it as needed. More details about configuring each type 
	of authentication can be above and <a href="../../ui/dialogs/session/contexts.html">here</a>.
