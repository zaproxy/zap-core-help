	<h1>Options Spider screen</h1>
	<p>
		This screen allows you to configure the <a
			href="../../../start/concepts/spider.html">spider</a> options.</p> 
	<p>It should be noted that modifying most of these options also affects
	the running Spider.
	</p>

	<h3>Maximum depth to crawl</h3>
	The parameter defines the maximum depth in the crawling process where a
	page must be found in order for it to be processed. Resources found
	deeper than this level are not fetched and parsed by the spider.
	<p>
		The depth is calculated starting from the seeds, so, if a Spider scan
		starts with only a single URL (eg. Spider URL), the depth is
		calculated from this one. However, if the scan starts with multiple
		seeds (eg. Spider site), a resource is processed if it's depth
		relative to <i>any</i> of the seeds is less than the defined one.
	</p>

	<h3>Number of threads used</h3>
	The spider is multi-threaded and this is the number that defines the
	maximum number of worker threads used in the crawling process. Changing this
	parameter does not have any effect on any crawling is in progress. 

	<h3>Domain Pattern</h3>
	The normal behavior of the spider is to only follow links to resources
	found on the same domain as the page where the scan started. However,
	this option allows you to define additional domains that are considered
	"in scope" during the crawling process. Pages on these domains are
	processed during the scan.
		
	<h3>Query parameters handling</h3>
	When crawling, the Spider has an internal mechanism that marks which pages
	were already visited, so they are not processed again. When this check is made,
	the way the URIs parameters are handled is set using this option. There are
	three available options:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Ignore parameters completely</b> - if www.example.org/?bar=456 is visited,
	then www.example.org/?foo=123 will not be visited</li>
	<li><b>Consider only parameter's name</b> (ignore parameter's value) - if 
	www.example.org/?foo=123 is visited, then www.example.org/?foo=456 will not be visited, 
	but www.example.org/?bar=789 or www.example.org/?foo=456&amp;bar=123 will be visited</li>
	<li><b>Consider both parameter's name and value</b> - if www.example.org/?123 is visited,
	any other uri that is different (including, for example, www.example.org/?foo=456 or 
	www.example.org/?bar=abc) will be visited</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Process forms</h3>
	During the crawling process, the behaviour of the spider when it
	encounters HTML forms is defined by this option. If disabled, the HTML
	forms will not be processed at all. If enabled, the HTML forms with the
	method defined as HTTP GET will be submitted with some generated
	values. The behaviour when encountering forms with the method defined
	as HTTP POST is configured by the next option.

	<h3>POST forms</h3>
	As briefly described in the previous paragraph (Process Forms), this
	option configures the behaviour of the spider when
	<i>Process Forms</i> is enabled and when encountering HTML forms that
	have to be POSTed.

	<h3>Parse HTML Comments</h3>
	This option defines whether the spider should also spider the HTML
	comments searching for links to resources. Only the resources found in
	commented valid HTML tags will be processed.

	<h3>Parse 'robots.txt' files</h3>
	This option defines whether the spider should also spider the
	robots.txt files found on websites, searching for links to resources.
	This option does not define whether the spider should follow the rules
	imposed by the robots.txt file.

	<h3>Handle OData-specific parameters</h3>
	This options defines whether the spider should try to detect OData-specific
	parameters (i.e. resources identifiers) in order to properly process them 
	according to the rule defined by the "Query parameters handling" option.
