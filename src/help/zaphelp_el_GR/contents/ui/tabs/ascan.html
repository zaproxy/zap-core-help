<h1>Active Scan tab</h1>

The Active Scan tab allows you to perform an <a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a>
on any of the sites that have been accessed.<br> 
<br>
Sites can be selected via the toolbar or the <a href="sites.html">Sites tab</a>.<br>
Any sites that have have been are are currently being scanned are marked in bold in the toolbar Sites pulldown control.<br>
The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and resume the scan selected.<br>
A progress bar shows how far the scan of the selected site has progressed.<br>
The 'Current scans' value shows how many scans are currently active - 
hovering over this value will show a list of the sites being scanned in a popup.
