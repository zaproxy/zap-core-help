<H1>Session Contexts dialogs</H1>
<p>
These screens allows you manage <a href="../../../start/concepts/contexts.html">contexts</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is a set of screens for each context you define.
</p>

<H3>Top screen</H3>
This allows you to set the context name and description.

<H3>Include in context</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be included in the context.<br/>
URLs which dont match any of the regexs will not be included in the context.

<H3>Exclude from context</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be excluded from the context.<br/>
You only need to specify regexs for URLs that you do not want to include but which match one or more
of the 'include' regexes.

<H3>Technology</H3>
This allows you to specify the technologies used in the context, if known.<br/>
By default all technologies are included.<br/>
If you exclude technologies that you know are not used then this may speed up 
<a href="../../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scanning</a> as rules specific to the excluded
technologies can be skipped.

<H3>Authentication</H3>
This allows you to manage the authentication related properties for this context.

<H2>URL regexs</H2>
In the <I>Include in *</I> and <I>Exclude from *</I> dialogs, you can enter regular expressions to define excluded URLs.
While you can escape a single meta-character with a backslash, you can also use the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence. All the characters between the <B>\Q</B> and the <B>\E</B> are interpreted as literal characters. E.g. \Q*\d+*\E matches the literal text *\d+*.
This escape sequence is used in ZAP when you exclude URLs via some context menus.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> If your URL contains a "\E", then you have to do the following steps when using the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence:
<UL>
	<LI>Open the escape sequence</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence before the "character" \E</LI>
	<LI>Escape the backslash</LI>
	<LI>Open after the "\E" another escape sequence;</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence as normally would.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Example: https://subdomain.example.com/path?a=<B>\E</B>&moredata=2 should appear as
<I>\Qhttps://subdomain.example.com/path?a=\E</I><B>\\E</B><I>\Q&moredata=2\E</I>
