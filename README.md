Welcome to the [OWASP ZAP](OWASP Zed Attack Proxy) (ZAP) User Guide.

This is available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online here in the [wiki](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki).

The English help files are under the [/src/help/zaphelp](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/tree/master/src/help/zaphelp) directory, so if you'd like to make a change, create a pull request against those files, and they will be updated in the wiki.

You can help translate those pages into other languages via the [OWASP ZAP Help Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-zap-help).
