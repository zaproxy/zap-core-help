Welcome to the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) User Guide.

This is available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online here in the [wiki](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki).

The English help files are under the [/src/help/zaphelp](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/tree/master/src/help/zaphelp) directory, so if you'd like to make a change, create a pull request against those files, and they will be updated in the wiki.

This User Guide has been translated into many languages, all of which are available via the [ZAP Marketplace](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions).

The most completely translated guides are also available online:
